        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>This is a simple page to demonstrate the impact of microplastic and microfiber pollution. We've aggregated a large sampling of everyday common household items to help visualize the average consumer's contribution.</p>

        <p class="q-question">What is a microfiber?</p>
        <p class="q-information">A microfiber is tiny fragment of the type of plastic used to make synthetic fabrics. These fibers are shed from synthetic clothing during a washing machine cycle. Because they are so small, microfibers aren’t all caught by wastewater treatment plants; instead, many are released into the environment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="q-block">
        <p class="q-question">How bad is the problem?</p>
        <p class="q-information">Right now, it’s estimated that fibers are, by count, the single largest contributor to watershed plastic pollution in developed countries and account for a significant portion of plastic waste entering the ocean. Though we don’t yet know the extent to which microplastic pollution might affect humans, we do know that many animals within the aquatic food chain ingest these plastics and the toxics they absorb from the water around them,  which can transfer to their tissue and cause gut impaction, hormone disruption, and liver damage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="q-block">
        <p class="q-question">Which fabrics cause microfiber pollution?</p>
        <p class="q-information">Both synthetic and natural fabrics can release microfibers with agitation and wear, however the natural fibers will quickly biodegrade. Polyester, acrylic, nylon or elastane are common synthetic fabrics that contribute to microfiber pollution.</p>
        <p class="q-information">A study from Plymouth University (Napper, 2016) suggested that an average 6kg load could release 138,000 polyester-cotton blended fibers, 496,000 polyester fibers and 729,000 acrylic fibers in a single wash. The distribution of fibers indicates acrylic fabrics release over 5 times more fibers than a 35/65 cotton/polyester blend and polyester releases over 3.5 times more.</p>

          <p class="q-question">SWARM Project Data Collection</p>
          <p class="q-information">Sixty students in our group identified at least 10 clothing items they used in their household with a breakdown of the type of fabric or fiber that was in each clothing item. All group respondents identified the type of fabric or fiber for each item identifying the fiber type; Cellulosic, Synthetic, or a mix of fibers, and what percentage each fiber element represented for the clothing item.</p>

      <h1>Analysis</h1>
      <p>The fact that <span style="color:#4A89DC;">56.80 %</span> of the fibers in our group clothing sample were made from materials that do not produce microfibers is positive considering the research that indicates that washed clothing discharges harmful synthetic microfibers into wastewaters reaching our beaches, oceans, rivers and atmosphere. (see Alexander-White, 2016 p. 4; Smith, 2017, p. 2).</p>
      <p>However, <span style="color:#E9573F;">42.95 %</span> of our sample included clothing fibers that were made from synthetic materials that include harmful synthetic material. In particular, 26.88 % of the synthetic fiber was polyester representing 62.66 % of the synthetic material reported by our group.</p>
      <p>The high percentage of polyester in our sample is particularly problematic because Smith (2010) explains that clothing with polyester fiber[s] “can release 700,000 fibers in a single wash” (Smith, 2017, p. 2). What is a particular concern, according to Messinger (2016) is that synthetic microfibers can potentially poison the food chain (see Messinger, 2016).</p>

      <h1>Solutions</h1>
      <p>Given the fact that synthetic microfibers are a major source of atmospheric pollution, it is important that we become aware of this problem and think about how we can develop solutions which involve changing our personal habits and advocating for societal change.</p>
      <p>Our group proposes that we consider the following solutions to take action on microfiber pollution:</p>
